# Introduction-to-the-Theory-and-Application-of-the-Machine-Learning
This is the Introduction to the Theory and Application of the Machine Learning in Python, which is a course of St. Petersburg University of Technology.
## Abstract of Machine Learning
Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering and computer vision, where it is difficult or infeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.

Machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers. The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning.In its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics.
> **Machine Learning Approaches**
> Machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories, depending on the nature of the "signal" or "feedback" available to the learning system:

Supervised learning: The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a "teacher", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs.
Unsupervised learning: No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end (feature learning).
Reinforcement learning: A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent). As it navigates its problem space, the program is provided feedback that's analogous to rewards, which it tries to maximize.
Other approaches have been developed which don't fit neatly into this three-fold categorisation, and sometimes more than one is used by the same machine learning system. For example topic modeling, dimensionality reduction or meta learning.

As of 2020, deep learning has become the dominant approach for much ongoing work in the field of machine learning.

## About the Project
This project originated from a mini-homework project in the advanced machine learning of St. Petersburg University of Technology, Russia. It is very suitable for getting started. It eliminates the cumbersome parts and retains the most critical and basic steps. It can have an understanding of the basic process of machine learning. The clearest understanding; use the housing information data of Moscow city to train and test a model, and test the performance and predictive ability of the model-especially the value of the house. For the daily work of real estate agents and others, such predictive models have proved very valuable.

This project is similar to the famous Boston Housing Price Prediction Project. It is a simpler machine learning entry project that can help us better understand machine learning related knowledge.
